# Design and implement a capacitive touch sensor-activated light stand.
## 1. Project scope
- Implement 3 MHz square wave signal generator using 555
- Design and implement capacitive touch sensor without micro controller
- Implement 120V power, step down to 5V for powering lower voltage section of board
- Using 120V to power light bulb, control on-off with a relay.
- Design circuit so that touch sensor latches on-off correctly.
